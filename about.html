      <h1>EUS 099.01 Berlin in the 20th Century: A HyperCities Mapbox Project</h1>
      <h3>Vanderbilt University Commons Seminar Spring 2015 & 2016</h3>

      <p><em>Taught by Professors Joy H. Calico and Peggy Setje-Eilers; Lindsey Fox, GIS Coordinator (Heard Library); and Clifford Anderson, Director of Scholarly Communications (Heard Library)</em></p>

      <p>Vanderbilt University’s Commons Seminars are experimental 1-credit courses offered to first-year students each spring semester. This seminar focuses on two things, and the final project is a synthesis of the two. One of those things was cultural history: we survey the culture and geopolitics of twentieth-century Berlin by focusing on several events since 1900. The other is an introduction to some of the questions and tools of the digital humanities based on the premise of HyperCities, “a collaborative research and educational platform for traveling back in time to explore the historical layers of city spaces in an interactive, hypermedia environment” http://hypercities.com/. Students learn to use several digital tools (GitHub, Atom, Cloudant, TileMill, Mapbox, GeoJSON) over the course of the semester and work on group projects in time travel, curating tours of Berlin built on historical maps since 1900. The tours include still and moving images, audio, historical documents, and prose. This website features the students’ final projects.</p>

      <p>The S16 students used the same maps the S15 students had used, and could not repeat points the previous class had already set.  Our hope is that the students in each iteration of the course will add new points to these five maps as our own project in thick mapping, producing ever richer, denser representations of Berlin in 1908, 1920, 1936, 1947, and 1970.</p>

      <h2>Course Objectives</h2>

      <h3>Students came away with</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>general knowledge of the cultural and political history of Berlin since 1900</li>
        <li>introductory-level understanding of issues pertaining to the digital humanities</li>
        <li> facility with GitHub, Atom, Cloudant, TileMill, Mapbox, and GeoJSON to demonstrate both (precise tools may vary by semester)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Required materials</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Todd Presner, David Shepard and Yoh Kawano, HyperCities: Thick Mapping in the Digital Humanities (Harvard University Press, 2014)</li>
        <li>Laptop for use in class</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Final Map Projects</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Berlin 1908: SS and James Troderman (2015); I.G. and John Maruyama (2016)</li>
        <li>Berlin 1920: Danielle Chandler and Melissa Nicandri (2015); Andrew Grant, Kavi Saxena, and Mira Yousef (2016)</li>
